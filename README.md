### Running rasa server
Make sure you are in the directory containing rasa model.
In our case, "chatbot-frame" then run this command

```
rasa run --enable-api --cors "*"

```

**The Rasa framework is currently deleted. It will be replaced with a new AI modle build ourselves. It's not finished yet.**
